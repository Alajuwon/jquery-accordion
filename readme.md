its week 3 on a thursday and yesterday we were assigned a task which was to make an box accordion with a few tab that involved a transition when clicked. I felt good about this assignment just because it looked fun to do. I think ive finally solved my problem with being confused in javascript. for example: in this assignment I have an "if" statement =====>>> if ("acd" === event.target.id){.... I literally have been reading the statement backwards when it comes to nesting. of course I understand that the id is within the target which is within the event, but when came to actually writting the fuction out my mind would go blank and then I would hit a wall. now that I have that out the way I feel a lot closer to understand how everything is pieced together... still iffy about some things though.......
